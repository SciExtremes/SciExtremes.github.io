abstract: The fragile ecological environment of the Mongolian Plateau (MP)
  is sensitive to climate change. It is necessary to fully understand the temperature
  and precipitation changes on the MP to ensure regional sustainable development.
  Most existing studies are conducted based on station observations which suffer from
  sparse distribution and limited spatial representativeness and cannot perfectly
  represent the climatic conditions of the whole region. By contrast, the long‐term,
  spatially continuous reanalysis products offer new opportunities for MP climate
  change research. However, the coarse spatial resolution and large uncertainties
  of reanalysis data limit their applicability to provide reliable climate information
  at finer scales. Within the delta downscaling framework, we downscale and correct
  the state‐of‐the‐art European Centre for Medium‐range Weather Forecasts ReAnalysis
  5 land portion (ERA5‐Land) using a high‐resolution WorldClim reference climatology
  and generate a long‐term (1950–2020) 1‐km monthly air temperature and precipitation
  downscaled dataset. During the downscaling process, the results obtained by nearest
  neighbour, bilinear and bicubic interpolation methods are evaluated and compared.
  Air temperature result of bilinear method and precipitation result of nearest neighbour
  method, which have the best accuracy, are taken as the final downscaled data. The
  evaluation shows that the downscaled data has acceptable accuracy (overall MBE = −0.41°C,
  Corr = 0.997, RMSE = 1.51°C for air temperature, and MBE = 1.58 mm·month −1 , Corr = 0.747,
  RMSE = 24.24 mm·month −1 for precipitation), and outperforms the original ERA5‐Land
  and widely used Climatic Research Unit (CRU) data. In addition, the downscaled data
  can also provide accurate and detailed temperature and precipitation change trends
  over the MP. With fine spatial resolution, long‐time span and good spatial continuity,
  the downscaled air temperature and precipitation will be a useful data source to
  explore climate change over the MP.
