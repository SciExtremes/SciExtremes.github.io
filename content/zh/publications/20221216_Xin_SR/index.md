abstract: Precipitation is an important component of the hydrological cycle and has
  significant impact on ecological environment and social development, especially
  in arid areas where water resources are scarce. As a typical arid and semi-arid
  region, the Mongolian Plateau is ecologically fragile and highly sensitive to climate
  change. Reliable global precipitation data is urgently needed for the sustainable
  development over this gauge-deficient region. With high-quality estimates, fine
  spatiotemporal resolutions, and wide coverage, the state-of-the-art Integrated Multi-satellite
  Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) and European Center for
  Medium-range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) have great potential for regional
  climatic, hydrological, and ecological applications. However, how they perform has
  not been well investigated on the Mongolian Plateau. Therefore, this study evaluated
  the performance of three IMERG V06 datasets (ER, LR and FR), two ERA5 products (ERA5-HRES
  and ERA5-Land), and their predecessors (TMPA-3B42 and ERA-Interim) over the region
  across 2001–2018. The results showed that all products broadly characterized seasonal
  precipitation cycles and spatial patterns, but only the three reanalysis products,
  IMERG FR and TMPA-3B42 could capture interannual and decadal variability. When describing
  daily precipitation, dataset performances ranked ERA5-Land textgreater ERA5-HRES textgreater ERA-Interim textgreater IMERG
  FR textgreater IMERG LR textgreater IMERG ER textgreater TMPA-3B42. All products
  showed deficiencies in overestimating weak precipitation and underestimating high-intensity
  precipitation. Besides, products performed best in agricultural lands and forests
  along the northern and south-eastern edges, followed by urban areas and grasslands
  closer to the center, and worst in the sparse vegetation and bare areas of the south-west.
  Due to a negative effect of topographic complexity, IMERG showed poor detection
  capabilities in forests. Accordingly, this research currently supports the applicability
  of reanalysis ERA5 data over the arid, topographically complex Mongolian Plateau,
  which can inform regional applications with different requirements.
