abstract: Snow-induced radiative forcing (SnRF), defined as the instantaneous perturbation
  of the Earth’s shortwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), results from
  variations in the terrestrial snow cover extent (SCE), and is critical for the regulation
  of the Earth’s energy budget. However, with the growing seasonal divergence of SCE
  over the Northern Hemisphere (NH) in the past two decades, novel insights pertaining
  to SnRF are lacking. Consequently, the contribution of SnRF to TOA shortwave radiation
  anomalies still remains unclear. Utilizing the latest datasets of snow cover, surface
  albedo, and albedo radiative kernels, this study investigated the distribution of
  SnRF over the NH and explored its changes from 2000 to 2019. The 20-year averaged
  annual mean SnRF in the NH was −1.13 ± 0.05 W m−2, with a weakening trend of 0.0047
  Wm−2 yr−1 (p textless 0.01) during 2000–2019, indicating that an extra 0.094 W m−2
  of shortwave radiation was absorbed by the Earth climate system. Moreover, changes
  in SnRF were highly correlated with satellite-observed TOA shortwave flux anomalies
  (r = 0.79, p textless 0.05) during 2000–2019. Additionally, a detailed contribution
  analysis revealed that the SnRF in snow accumulation months, from March to May,
  accounted for 58.10% of the annual mean SnRF variability across the NH. These results
  can assist in providing a better understanding of the role of snow cover in Earth’s
  climate system in the context of climate change. Although the rapid SCE decline
  over the NH has a hiatus for the period during 2000–2019, SnRF continues to follow
  a weakening trend. Therefore, this should be taken into consideration in current
  climate change models and future climate projections.
