Using ERA5 hourly data on single levels of 2 m temperature, wind speed, dewpoint temperature and solar radiation, this study developed a global apparent temperature and heat wave (GATHW) toolbox based on the Climate Data Store (CDS) online platform. This toolbox allows three methods to calculate daily apparent temperature and heat wave at three spatial resolutions of 0.25°, 0.5° and 1°, respectively. It can realize online calculation, display and real-time download of apparent temperature and heat wave data, and is update in near real-time.

The global daily apparent temperature and annual heat wave dataset from 2006 to 2020 calculated by the toolbox can be obtained from the National Qinghai Tibet Plateau Scientific Data Centre of China (https://www.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4764325).

After evaluation, this dataset can well reflect the typical extreme temperatures and heat wave events, and is more accurate, with higher resolution and faster update frequency than similar data products, which can provide data support for the study of human-environmental ecological processes and extreme climate events.
