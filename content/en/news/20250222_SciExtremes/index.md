On February 22, 2025, I launched a WeChat public account called Extreme Science, focusing on extreme hydroclimatic events such as wildfires and heatwaves. The goal is to share original research, cutting-edge developments in the field, and practical resources.

The primary motivation behind creating this platform was to document my research progress and keep a record of technical challenges and solutions I encounter in daily work. I’ve found it to be a helpful way to revisit knowledge, skills, and ideas.

As of today (August 3, 2025), the account has attracted 944 followers and accumulated over 10,000 total reads—an encouraging milestone that motivates me to keep going.
